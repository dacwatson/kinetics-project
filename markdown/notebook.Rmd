## Setting Up

So the first thing we need to do is read our data from the .csv files and create R data objects (called "tibbles") out of them.

We begin by importing the `readr` library from the `tidyverse` package, which allows us to read various types of file formats easily.

We also import the `here` library, which allows us to interface easier with our filesystem.

Once we've done that, we will have access to the `read_csv()` and the `here()` functions.

- *`Library`--- a collection of prewritten functions.*

```{r}
library(readr)
library(here)
```

As you saw when we loaded the `here` library, `here()` simply prints a string containing our home directory:

```{r}
here()
```

Now that we have our tools all arranged, we need to take a look at our raw data and clean it up a bit.


### Data Cleaning

This is what our data looks like when we export it from gen5:

We want to clean this up because we don't want any extraneous data when manipulating our data objects.

Let's delete the unnecessary temperature column and save as `.csv` to remove the formatting.

Now our data is compatible with our `read_csv()` function.
